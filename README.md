# Amazon QuickSight Data Analysis Project

Welcome to my Amazon QuickSight Data Analysis Project! This project is part of my portfolio as I apply for Business Analyst roles. It showcases my ability to create and visualize data using Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and Amazon QuickSight. Below, you'll find a detailed overview of the project, which demonstrates my skills in data analysis, visualization, and cloud-based business intelligence.

## Project Overview

In this tutorial, I guide you through the process of creating and visualizing data in an Amazon RDS MS SQL Express server using Amazon QuickSight. This project highlights my proficiency in setting up and managing cloud-based SQL Server deployments, as well as my ability to derive insights from data using Amazon QuickSight.

### Key Features

- **Amazon RDS for SQL Server**: Simplifies the setup, operation, and scaling of SQL Server deployments in the cloud.
- **Amazon QuickSight**: A scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered Business Intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud.
- **Seamless Integration**: Using the Amazon RDS connector in Amazon QuickSight, organizations can gather insights from RDS data without writing a single line of code.

## Tutorial Steps

### 1. Create a Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition Database in Amazon RDS
- Set up an Amazon RDS instance with Microsoft SQL Server Express Edition.
- Configure the necessary settings for optimal performance and security.

### 2. Download and Connect to a Microsoft SQL Server Client
- Install a SQL Server client (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio).
- Connect to the Amazon RDS instance using the client.

### 3. Create a Sample Database and Tables, and Load Sample Data
- Create a sample database and tables within the SQL Server instance.
- Load sample data into the tables to be accessed in Amazon QuickSight.

### 4. Enable Security Groups on Amazon RDS for Amazon QuickSight
- Configure security groups to allow Amazon QuickSight to connect to the RDS datasets securely.

### 5. Create an Amazon QuickSight Account
- Sign up for an Amazon QuickSight account if you don't already have one.
- Configure the account settings for optimal use.

### 6. Enable Amazon QuickSight to Connect to Amazon RDS and Create a Dataset
- Enable the Amazon RDS connector in Amazon QuickSight.
- Create a dataset from the RDS data for visualization purposes.

### 7. Clean Up Resources
- Ensure all resources are properly cleaned up to avoid unnecessary charges.
- Delete the RDS instance and any other resources created during the tutorial.

## Sample Data

A sample data source is provided for use during this tutorial. The data source, `Sales Orders.xlsx.zip`, is publicly available as the Global Superstore dataset on Kaggle. This dataset includes a variety of sales order data, which is ideal for demonstrating data analysis and visualization techniques.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates my ability to work with cloud-based data services and business intelligence tools. By following this tutorial, I have showcased my skills in setting up and managing SQL Server databases in the cloud, as well as my proficiency in using Amazon QuickSight for data visualization and analysis.

I hope this project provides a clear example of my capabilities as a Business Analyst. Thank you for taking the time to review my work!
